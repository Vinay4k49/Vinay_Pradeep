  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:100SMILES Dental Care</strong></p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>Our goals are to provide a full spectrum of preventive and restorative care to keep your smile healthy and beautiful and prioritize patient education, ensuring you have the knowledge and resources to make informed decisions about your dental health.  Dental Care is dedicated to providing services that nurture the health and happiness of our clients. Our promise is to deliver the highest standard of care for our patients, regardless of their age or dental needs. Our dedicated team of dentists and support staff shares a profound commitment to dental health, ensuring that our patients receive the attention and treatment they deserve</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The best way to measure the success of the website will be to check the number of new patient appointments initiated directly through the website. We can also monitor the success of the educational content (e.g., articles) will be evaluated by tracking visitor engagement and total time spent on those pages.</p>
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>The most important target audience for the 100SMILES Dental Care website is local families in the Razole area, specifically parents aged 25-45. This group acts as the primary healthcare decision-maker for their household, managing appointments for themselves, their partners, and their children.</p>
  <p>I will intentionally design this website for the specific target audience by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Building Trust: Using a professional and user friendly design that features staff bios and qualifications to assure parents of the quality of care.</li>
    <li>Making it Easy: I will make sure the phone number , address , and all opening hours —especially the weekend times are easy to find adn understand.</li>
    <li>Featuring the Welcome Offer: I will make the "20% discount on your first dental visit when you book through email"  a clear, simple and tempting button, encouraging them to book that first appointment.</li>
  </ul>
